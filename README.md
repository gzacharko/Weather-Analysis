# Weather-Analysis
Repository for my "Weather Data Analysis Project" for my "Advanced Programming Workshop II" course at Rowan College at Burlington County (RCBC). The program is written in Java and was coded using the Eclipse IDE.

***Please read the "Weather Data Project Main Design Document" to see this Project's implemenation.***

There is an executable JAR file included so you can easily run the program.
